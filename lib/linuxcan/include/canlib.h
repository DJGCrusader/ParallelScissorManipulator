 * \source_end
 *
 * Opens a CAN channel (circuit) and returns a handle which is used
 * in subsequent calls to CANLIB.
 *
 *
 * Channel numbering is dependent on the installed hardware. The first channel
 * always has number 0.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * \li If you have a single LAPcan, the channels are numbered 0 and 1.
 *
 * \li If you have a USBcan Professional, the channels are numbered 0-1
 *     according to the labels on the cables.
 *
 * \li The virtual channels come after all physical channels.
 *
 * If you are using multiple threads, note that the returned handle is usable
 * only in the context of the thread that created it. That is, you must call
 * \ref canOpenChannel() in each of the threads in your application that uses the
 * CAN bus. You can open the same channel from multiple threads, but you must
 * call \ref canOpenChannel() once per thread.
 *
 * If you are using the same channel via multiple handles, note that the
 * default behaviour is that the different handles will "hear" each other just as
 * if each handle referred to a channel of its own. If you open, say, channel 0
 * from thread A and thread B and then send a message from thread A, it will be
 * "received" by thread B.
 * This behaviour can be changed using \ref canIOCTL_SET_LOCAL_TXECHO.
 *
 * \note The handle returned may be zero which is perfectly valid.
 *
 * \note This call replaces the \ref canOpen() API call and serves the same purpose.
 *
 * \param[in]  channel  The number of the channel. Channel numbering is hardware
 *                      dependent.
 * \param[in]  flags    A combination of \ref canOPEN_xxx flags
 *
 * \return Returns a handle to the opened circuit, or \ref canERR_xxx
 *         (negative) if the call failed.
