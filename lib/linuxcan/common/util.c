** CRC32 routine. It is recreating its table for each calculation.
** This is by design - it is not intended to be used frequently so we
** perfer to save some memory instead.
**
** The following C code (by Rob Warnock <rpw3@sgi.com>) does CRC-32 in
** BigEndian/BigEndian byte/bit order.  That is, the data is sent most
** significant byte first, and each of the bits within a byte is sent most
** significant bit first, as in FDDI. You will need to twiddle with it to do
** Ethernet CRC, i.e., BigEndian/LittleEndian byte/bit order. [Left as an
** exercise for the reader.]
**
** The CRCs this code generates agree with the vendor-supplied Verilog models
** of several of the popular FDDI "MAC" chips.
